Memorization helper -- generate Anki cards with letters progressively replaced with blanks.

This will take a file and create a text file with one row per line. Each row will progressively remove letters from the original string over several columns. Then you can use an app like Anki to create multiple flashcards per row, getting progressively harder.

This comes from an idea I had about how to memorize Bible verses. So far it seems to work.
